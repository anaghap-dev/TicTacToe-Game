This is a simple **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in Python, where you can play against a friend or the computer. The game supports a 3x3 board, where players take turns to mark their symbols (X or O). The objective of the game is to be the first to align three symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
